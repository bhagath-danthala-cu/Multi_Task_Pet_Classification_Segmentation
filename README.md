# Multi Task Pet Classification & Segmentation

Multi-Task Pet Classification Segmentation is a multi-task computer vision project that performs simultaneous classification and semantic segmentation of pets in images. This project aims to offer an efficient and effective pipeline to identify pet breeds (classification) and segment their outlines or bodies (segmentation) concurrently.

##  Features
- **Dual-Task Pipeline**  
  - **Classification**: Predict the breed or species of pets in the image.  
  - **Segmentation**: Generate a pixel-wise mask to outline the pet(s).
- **End-to-End Training**  
  Single go-to framework for both tasks using shared backbone architecture.
- **Lightweight & Scalable**  
  Designed to run efficiently on limited hardware, with room for extension to larger architectures or additional tasks.
